# What it does
PitMate takes two or more pressure readings and forms pit stratergies for all track temps commonly found in ACC.

This allows you to create pit strats for every track temperature with minimal effort.
With default settings the strat numbers will match the track temp they are created for
e.g strat 22 is for a 22c track

# How to use
1. Find the optimum pressures at 2 or more track temperatures(recommended 3)
2. Enter the cold pressure for each tyre & track temp the reading was taken at then click add reading
3. Repeat step 2 for each reading
Once 2 or more readings are added a graph will be updated to show expected pressures over a temperature range
4. Load the setup that was used to take the readings, if you're using a default setup save it as a new setup
5. edit optional settings
6. Press "set pit strats" - this will create a new setup
7. Load & use the setup ingame

# Important considerations

Optimal tyre pressures vary based on many factors, here's some tips to avoid getting the pressures wrong in a race:

Changes to setup change how much each tyre is worn & how much temperature it builds up & therefore to optimal starting pressure.
Always finish your setup before wasting time figuring out correct pressures & don't use pressures from other setups

Changes in track condition / grip levels cause heat to build up at different rates & will cause the set stratergies to be too high or low depending.
Make note of if your testing was in optimum/fast/green & go up or down a few strats in a race accordingly
